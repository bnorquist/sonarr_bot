# sonarr_bot

sonarr_bot can: tell you what series are currently subscribed on sonarr, add a new series, tell you what shows will be airing that day, and search for and download movies using radarr (fork of sonarr)

__TO-DO__
* Implement .env to store api keys (instead of api_keys.py)
* Expand help method
* Implement confirmation of successful subscription in bot.add_show()
* Implement recur + get_calendar() from sonarr_api to post shows airing each night
* Radarr methods and wrapper (for movies rather than tv shows)
* Add tests
* Heroku or server deployment
